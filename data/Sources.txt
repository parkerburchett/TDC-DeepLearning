similar_smiles.csv and unique_smiles.csv 
come from taking a subset of the training data and gathering all other molecules that are similar to them from chembal.

See the function on_colab_get_similar_smiles() in ../Data Wrangling.ipynb


I downloaded data\UnlabeledSmilesDataset.csv from

https://www.kaggle.com/antifact/molecular-translation-smiles-csv/code

There are no descriptions of the smiles at all. It is just a 250k large list of smiles without any features. 
I don't if they are valid smiles or where they come from. Might be good enough for unlabeled feature extraction


Caster_data came from this repo https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/CASTER

This is the repo with the to train the NN for the CASTER Drug Drug interaction Paper.
